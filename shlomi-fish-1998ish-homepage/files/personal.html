I was born on May 1977 in Israel. When I was about 1 year old, my
parents moved to the States for my Father's Post-Doctorat. I stayed
there until I was 5, and my sister was born while we stayed in
Dallas, Texas.

My other sister was born after we returned to Israel. Here, I went
to kinder-garden, and to elementary school. Afterwards, I studied in
Gimnasia Hertzelia in both junior high and high school, and I graduated
from high school at the summer of 95'. <P>

I spent some time working as a programmer and computer developer for
several computer-related companies. I gained a lot of knowledge and
experience in the process, and met some very supportive people in the
industry. In October 97' I began studying Electrical Engineering in the 
<A HREF="http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion</A>. I quite enjoy my
studies, even though it's still only Math, Physics and other
introductory material.<P>

I am particularily intersted in mathematics, computing and physics.
I've been programming since I was 10 years old, but it was not very
serious until I started working as a programmer two years ago. As for 
math, it's been a favourite of mine since junior high. (I'm also
interested in etymology and anicent history of the Near East and
Europe, but in a rather un-professional manner).<P>

Other hobbies of mine include a small amount of sports (my friends 
are serving in the army now, so I don't get to play much basketball and
football as I'd like to), hiking, and solving puzzles and riddles of all
sorts.<P>

I recently started to write a funny story which I call "The Enemy and
how I Helped to Fight it". I just finished its third draft and I
hope to get it published.<P>

I hope you enjoy my website!
