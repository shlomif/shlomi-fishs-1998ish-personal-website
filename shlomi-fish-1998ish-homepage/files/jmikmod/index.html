<H3>MikMod for Java</H3>

Well, here it is: the long awaited (yeah right) Java port of MikMod.
You can download it <A HREF="jmm-03.03.98.zip">here</A>.<P>

Right now, the archive contains a JDK 1.0.2 code, which can still
compile on versions 1.1.x of the JDK, with some compiler warnings.
The "native" sound driver source inside will only compile and work on
Linux and v. 1.0.2 of the JDK.<P>

Like I say in the README file, I'll be happy to let another person
coordinate and maintain this "project" instead of me. I, on my part,
intended to invest a small amount of further work on it, if at all.<P>

Enjoy!
