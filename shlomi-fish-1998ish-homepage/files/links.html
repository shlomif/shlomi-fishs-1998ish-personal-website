<H1>My Cool Links List</H1>

<A HREF="http://www.technion.ac.il/"><H3>The Technion Home Page</H3></A>
<A HREF="http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/"><H3>Faculty of Electrical Engineering</H3></A>

The university where I study and my faculty.

<BR><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.smlink.com/"><H3>Smart Link</H3></A>

The comapny I just recently worked in. Smart Link develops Software based
modems for Windows 95, based on Sound chips (so you usually get a
fully operational soundcard without extra cost).

<A HREF="http://www.cortext.co.il/"><H3>Cortext Web Design</H3></A>

Those are my previous workplaces. Check them out, if you'd like.

<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Philosophy/Objectivism/"><H3>Yahoo's Objectivism Branch</H3></A>

I became very interested in Objectivism in the past few years, so I recommend
you take a look. Objectivism is a school of philosphy that deals with politics,
ethics, law, and art to say the least. It has a human and freedom centered philosophy,
yet is very strong and uncompromising.<BR>
The Yahoo branch is a good place to start looking for Objectivist resources
on the web, and there is a lot of introductury material there.
<BR><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.neo-tech.com/"><H3>Neo-Tech Homepage</H3></A>

"Neo-Tech" is an extension of Objectivism that I also became familiar with. It has
some substancial additions over Objectivism. For example, it integrates
psychology and business advisory into the philosphy.<BR>
Neo-Tech is fully commercial, so you can only find a sample of its material
on the company's website. If you are more serious about it, you'd better
order "The Neo-Tech Discovery", the main book of Neo-Tech by (snail) mail.

<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/"><H3>The Linux' Homepage</H3></A>
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org.il/"><H3>The Israeli Linux User's Group</H3></A>

To say that I'm interested in computers would be like saying that Albert Einstein
was a <B>good</B> physicist. Having cought the UNIX bug on one of my previous jobs
, I am still keeping and experiencing with Linux on my home computer. Linux is
a free UNIX-compatible operating system available for PCs and other machines. I
recommend it to anyone who wants to experiment with UNIX on his PC.<BR>

The Linux' homepage contains most of the information you'll need to know about
the Linux operating system. I'm also a member of the Israely Linux User's Group,
which is the local Linux mailing list and users "guild".<BR>

<H3>Cool and non-Commercial Software</H3>

Here's a short list of free software which I found to be very useful:

<A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp">The DJGPP Collection</A> - A collection of many
GNU utilities for DOS, that support Win95's long filenames. Anything from grep,
sed and the Bourne shell to a 32 bit C/C++ compiler.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.perl.hip.com/">Perl for Win32</A> - A Windows 95 and NT version of
what is, IMO, the world's best scripting langauge.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache HTTP server</A> - Version 1.3 of this popular
(and excellent) web server for UNIXes includes a Windows 95/NT version, too.<BR>
It's still in beta stage, but seems very nice.<BR>

<A HREF="http://ixtas.fri.uni-lj.si/~markom/fte/">The FTE Editor</A> - A very nice console
editor for many platforms that has color syntax highlighting, regular expression support,
auto-identation and other features. Fully User-configurable. The built-in
auto-identation can be irritating sometimes, though.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://sunscript.sun.com/">Tcl/Tk</A> - Another popular scripting
language which can be used to develop portable GUI-based applications.<BR>
You can also check
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html">SCO's resource page</A>
that conatins many Tcl/Tk related links.<BR>

MOD Files are music files that are based on recorded instruments, played at
various frequenecies to generate the various notes. MOD files can be played on
every machine that has a digital audio channel, and generate music with up
