<p>
A friend of mine and a fellow student of his wrote a computer program to 
manage a corriculum for a school for their high school project in technology.
However, what the program could not do was organize the constraints of the
various classes based on the constraints given by the organizer.
</p>

<p>
A few years afterwards my friend decided to re-write the program so it 
would be able to do such a thing. He gathered a few programmers, among them
me, and started coding and planning.
</p>

<p>
One of the problems he, another guy who was working on the project and I 
wanted to solve was the following: one is given a set of classes, a set of
hours, and an hourtable that specifies which classes should be taught at 
which hours. One is also given a certain number of teachers, and would should
find a valid assignment of teachers to classes, so that each class will be
taught by exactly one teacher.
